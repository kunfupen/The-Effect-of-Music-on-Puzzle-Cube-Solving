# The-Effect-of-Music-on-Puzzle-Cube-Solving
"The Effect of Music on Puzzle Cube Solving," investigates how different music genres—classical, heavy metal, and no music—impact cognitive function, particularly in solving a puzzle cube. Utilizing a split-plot experimental design, the study examines both the within-subject factor (music genre) and the between-subject factor (sequence of music presentation), with gender as a blocking factor.

Thirty-six participants were randomly assigned to three groups, each experiencing a different sequence of music genres. Participants listened to each music genre for 10 minutes before solving a puzzle cube. The data analysis, performed using repeated measures ANOVA, revealed that both the music genre and the order of presentation significantly influenced puzzle-solving performance. Classical music enhanced performance compared to no music, while heavy metal was associated with the slowest solving times. The sequence of music presentation also affected performance, suggesting possible learning or fatigue effects. Although gender differences were not statistically significant, they approached significance, indicating potential variations in response to different music genres.

The study supports the idea that classical music can enhance cognitive performance, while heavy metal may impair it. These findings have practical implications for educational and workplace settings, suggesting that appropriate music could enhance cognitive activities. The study also highlights the importance of considering the sequence of music exposure and individual differences in future research to further understand the impact of music on cognitive function.
